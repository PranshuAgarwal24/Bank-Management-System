# Bank-Management-System
This project demonstrates the basic workflow of a banking system using credit card.
This project deals with authentication of a credit card pin by using Luhn’s algorithm. The 
Luhn’s algorithm, also known as mod 10 algorithm is widely used to authenticate credit cards, 
IMEI numbers, and insurance numbers. This is a simple code demonstrating how this 
algorithm works on credit card pins . After authentication you can get access to banking facilities like withdraw,deposit,balance amd loan eligibility.
